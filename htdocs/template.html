      In 1942, Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company commissioned J. Howard Miller to create propaganda posters directed at women in the civilian labor force. Made with the intent of boosting the morale of Westinghouse employees, this image became an icon of its time, appealing to women throughout America. With booming production and a shortage of male workers due to the draft, women, retirees, and students filled the many vacant factory jobs during World War II. This image portrays the lifestyle of those women as one of patriotism, confidence, and hard work. With an attractive and groomed appearance, the woman pictured here glamorizes the notion of female labor, suggesting that femininity need not be sacrificed in order to work.
