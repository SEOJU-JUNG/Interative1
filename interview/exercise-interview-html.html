      </div>
      <p>
        He thinks a <span id="emphasize">'good'</span> screen-based design should have a clear topic and straight forward meaning.

        The web impacts positively on graphic designers.; It became much more convenient for graphic designers thanks to the advent of the web. You can save your design work or portfolio on your website and share them with people from all over the world. Additionally, I think it is based on the viewer’s demands to make the web more fit to their intended audience and customers, so he thinks the internet has changed and still changing graphic design over time.
