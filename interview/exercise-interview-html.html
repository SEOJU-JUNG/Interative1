    1. What is ‘good’ screen-based design?

    He thinks a 'good' screen-based design should have a clear topic and straight forward meaning. Because the viewers are from all around the world Online, so it's better to be recognizable to deliver plain meaning.
    Also, he agrees that "the clean design relies on pixel-perfect execution of many subtle design elements."



    2. How is art-making online different then art-making offline?

  He thinks that art-making offline seems to be more manual while art-making online is more technical.  Also, art-making offline contains more own Individuality.



    3. What do you think is the ‘purpose’ of the web?

    The purpose of the web would be 'convenience.'; The web functions very conveniently on our daily lives. For instance, online shopping, search engines, and social networks that able to contact our friends beyond the sea.


    4. How has your view of the internet / how you experience being online changed over time?

So, there are much more options to do Online compared to back in the days.


     5. How does the web impact graphic design?
    The web impacts positively on graphic designers.; It became much more convenient for graphic designers thanks to the advent of the web. You can save your design work or portfolio on your website and share them with people from all over the world. Additionally, I think it is based on the viewer’s demands to make the web more fit to their intended audience and customers, so he thinks the internet has changed and still changing graphic design over time.


    6. Does web freely open to everyone in your country?
    Yes, people in China are able to access the internet but partially limited. You can not use Google, Youtube, Facebook, and other social networks in China.

    7. Do you have any web making experience before interactive1 class?  

    Unlike we are doing in our class, the only experience I had with web making is using “Wix” which seems like only need to add words and move the layouts.
