                Webtoons are Digital Free Comics Service Platform, a type of webcomic that originated in South Korea. While webtoons were mostly unknown outside of the country during their inception, there has been a surge in popularity internationally thanks in great part to most comics being read on smartphones.

                As digital comics have emerged as a popular medium, the print publication of manhwa in South Korea has decreased.              </div>

              Even though it is the debut work of a young artist, this work has received exceptionally positive reviews through outstanding storytelling and the illustration of the characters’ emotions. It may look like a regular romantic comedy comic, but the artist calls it a ‘Dark Campus Battle Romance’. Specifically speaking, it is more close to a Daily Drama + Mystery (+Mystery Thriller) with a touch of romance added to it. In 2016, Cheese in the Trap was made as a TV series.

              College diary is so realistic. It is a comic that literally illustrates college students’ real life. Titles, such as the 1st episode ‘Course Registration’, 6th episode ‘The floral meaning of Cherry Blossoms: Midterm Exams’, 7th episode ‘A Handwritten Essay’, and 9th episode ‘Textbook’, accurately depicts the life of college students. However, since there are vacations in between semesters, there are many episodes besides college life that illustrate the daily life of Jakka.
